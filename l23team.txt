What is a Team's Repository Direct Access?
When you create a Team in a GitHub Organization, you can decide which repositories that team can access.

Default Access: You can set a default permission level for all repositories in the organization (like Read-only).

Direct Access: You can give specific repositories to that team with special permissions (like Write or Admin).
These repositories are called “repositories with direct access” because they were manually assigned to the team.
